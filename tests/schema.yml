data_tests:
  - name: assert_order_item_discount_is_in_range
    description: >
      Discount is a deducted percentage of the price, so it should be between 0 (0%) and 1 (100%).
      Therefore return records where min_discount < 0 or max_discount > 1 make the test fail.
  - name: assert_stock_quantity_is_not_negative
    description: >
      Stock is a remaining quantity, so it should always be >= 0.
      Therefore return records where min_quantity < 0 make the test fail.
